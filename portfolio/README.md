This project is made made using react node js and this uses mongodb in backend for data base ; 

This project uses 4 functional webpages which are routed as the following paths ;

 (The sign up page)  =   " http://localhost:3000/Signup "
 (The login page) = "http://localhost:3000/Login"
 (The landing / home page) = "http://localhost:3000/LandingPage"
 (The Game page ) = "http://localhost:3000/Game1"

The game is  a crossward game that allows user to solve the crossward puzzle following the hints given in the hint box;

and once you are completed with your answers you can verify your answers by
using the check button ; if your answer is right the respective hint gets hilighted in green ;

if something is wrong it is highlighted in red.


this projet saves the user name , email , password in backend for authentication,
and to display the user name on landing page;

and it also saves the user progres like the number of puzzles solved

there are three games shown on the landing page , 

but only one (the space puzzle) is functional for now other two are dummy puzzles;























































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
